            What&rsquo;s in the SDK</h3>
          <p>
            The following list describes all the items that are installed as part of the ReSharper
            SDK. Let&rsquo;s start with the items installed into the ReSharper SDK folder.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <p>
                <a href="Bin">Bin</a> &mdash; this folder contains <em>all</em> of ReSharper&rsquo;s
                assemblies, including assemblies that ReSharper relies on. In addition, this folder
                contains the PDBs for the ReSharper&rsquo;s assemblies, as well as the full ReSharper
                test infrastructure.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                <a href="Samples">Samples</a> &mdash; this folder contains a sample implementation
                of a ReSharper plug-in, complete with corresponding tests.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
            	<p>
                	<a href="Tools">Tools</a> &mdash; this folder contains the tools that are
                    used for developing support for new languages.</p>
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            In addition to the SDK folders, ReSharper also installs Visual Studio templates
            for quickly creating projects or individual plug-in items. These items are typically
            installed into Visual Studio&rsquo;s own <code>\ItemTemplates</code> and <code>\ProjectTemplates</code>
            folders.</p>
          <p>
            There&rsquo;s just one more thing that gets installed: the target files for ReSharper
            plug-ins and corresponding test projects. Both exist under your <code>&lt;ProgramFiles&gt;\MSBuild</code>
            directory. These files are used by the project template to quickly add references
            to all ReSharper assemblies to your project.</p>
          <p>There are 8 target files overall: four files for plugin development and four files for testing. The test files end with <code>.Tests.Targets</code>. Each group consists of four separate target files as follows:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><p>The <code>.Common.Targets</code> file contains the default values for the installation path of the SDK, the location of its binaries as well as tools.</p></li>
            <li><p>The <code>.References.Targets</code> file contains a link to each of the reference assemblies required for plugin development or testing.</p></li>
            <li><p>The <code>.NoReferences.Targets</code> file contains only a link to the <code>.Common.Targets</code> files and nothing else.</p></li>
            <li><p>The &lsquo;main&rsquo; target files (<code>Plugin.Targets</code> and <code>Plugin.Test.Targets</code>) contain links to both the <code>Common</code> files as well as <code>References</code> files. These are the files that are actually used by the templates.</p></li>
          </ul>
          <h3 id="GettingStarted">
            Getting Started</h3>
          <p>
            To get a feel for the way in which plug-ins are developed, open up the <a href="Samples/SamplePlugin">
              sample project</a> in the <a href="Samples">Samples</a> folder. This project illustrates
            the following ReSharper features:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <p>
                A code cleanup module</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                A context action</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                A daemon stage</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                An element problem analyzer</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                A quick-fix</p>
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Of course, the SDK itself is not limited to just these items: there are many more
            available.</p>
          <p>
            Once you&rsquo;ve familiarized yourself with the sample project, go ahead and create
            one of your own! The project templates for ReSharper plug-ins are available for
            both Visual Basic and Visual C#. Corresponding test project templates are also available.</p>
          <p>
            <strong>Hint:</strong> ReSharper plug-in development is a lot easier if you use
            the tools such as the Psi Viewer which are available in ReSharper&rsquo;s Internal
            Mode. To enable Internal Mode, edit Visual Studio&rsquo;s shortcut, adding the string
            <code>/ReSharper.Internal</code> to the end. Restart Visual Studio to see an additional
            Internal menu under the ReSharper top-level menu.</p>
          <h3 id="Samples">
            Samples</h3>
          <p>
            The SDK comes with three sets of samples, all of which demonstrate the different
            aspects of ReSharper that can be extended.</p>
          <p>
            First, in the <code>SamplePlugin</code> folder, we have a plug-in that shows how
            a single feature&nbsp;&ndash; the option to convert <code>MaxValue</code> integer
            literals into correspondingly named constants. The <code>SamplePlugin</code> shows
            how to implement the following features:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <p>
                Action</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                Context Action</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                Quick-Fix</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                Daemon Stage</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                Problem Analyzer</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                Code Cleanup</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                Options Page</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                Settings</p>
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            as well as the associated tests.</p>
          <p>
            The second set of examples is the ReSharper PowerToys. The PowerToys contain several
            projects illustrating different features of ReSharper extensibility, as shown in
            the table below.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <p>
                <strong>CyclomaticComplexity:</strong> Daemon Stage, Highlighting, Options Page, Settings</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                <strong>ExploreTypeInterface:</strong> Action, Tool Window</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                <strong>FindText:</strong> Action, Search</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                <strong>GenerateDispose:</strong> Generator</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                <strong>Gist:</strong> Action, Settings, OptionsPage</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                <strong>LiveTemplatesMacro:</strong> Live Template Macro</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                <strong>MakeMethodGeneric:</strong> Refactoring</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                <strong>MenuItem:</strong> Action</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                <strong>OptionsPage:</strong> Settings, Options Page</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                <strong>Xml and Html:</strong> Context Action</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                <strong>ZenCoding:</strong> Action, Options Page</p>
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>The third set of examples involves the Psi language plugin contained in the <code>PsiPlugin</code> and <code>PsiPluginTest</code> folders. This set of examples illustrate the concepts used in developing support for new languages for ReSharper. Further details are outlined in the following section.</p>
          <h3 id="NewLanguageDevelopmentSupport">Tools</h3>
<p>The SDK comes with extensive infrastructure and samples for developing support for new languages. The <code>Tools</code> folder of the SDK contains several tools which can be used for new language development, including:</p>
<ul>
  <li><p><strong>CsLex</strong>&nbsp;&mdash; a tool for creating lexical analysers for different languages.</p></li>
  <li><p><strong>Java</strong>&nbsp;&mdash; contains IKVM infrastructure which permits the running of the Java-based parser generator.</p></li>
  <li><p><strong>MSBuild</strong>&nbsp;&mdash; contains build tasks that can be used to automate lexer and parser construction.</p></li>
  <li><p><strong>parserGen</strong>&nbsp;&mdash; a tool for creating ReSharper-compatible parsers.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>In addition to the tools, the SDK also comes with a full language plugin example located in the <code>Samples\PsiPlugin</code> folder. This sample is a full implementation of a language plugin for supporting PSI files, which are parser definition files used by parserGen. As a result, plugin developers interested in using parserGen for new language development are advised to compile and install <code>PsiPlugin</code>, which can greatly simplify the process of working with parser definition files.</p>
          <h3 id="ManuallyCreatingProjects">
            Manually Creating/Porting Existing Projects</h3>
          <p>
            In some cases, you might not want to use a project template &ndash; for example,
            if you already have a plug-in project for ReSharper 5 and you want it to convert
            it to ReSharper 6 or 7. In this case, the first thing you need to do is remove all existing
              references to ReSharper assemblies. Then, simply unload the project and edit
            it manually. Add the following lines to the end of the project file:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              For a plug-in project, add the following line:
              <pre>
&lt;PropertyGroup&gt;
  &lt;ReSharperSdkTargets Condition=" '$(ReSharperSdkTargets)' == '' "&gt;
    $(MSBuildExtensionsPath)\JetBrains\ReSharper.SDK\v7.0
  &lt;/ReSharperSdkTargets&gt;
&lt;/PropertyGroup&gt;
&lt;Import Project="$(ReSharperSdkTargets)\Plugin.Targets" /&gt;
</pre>
            </li>
            <li>
              For a plug-in test project, add the following line:
              <pre>
&lt;PropertyGroup&gt;
  &lt;ReSharperSdkTargets Condition=" '$(ReSharperSdkTargets)' == '' "&gt;
    $(MSBuildExtensionsPath)\JetBrains\ReSharper.SDK\v7.0
  &lt;/ReSharperSdkTargets&gt;
&lt;/PropertyGroup&gt;
&lt;Import Project="$(ReSharperSdkTargets)\Plugin.Tests.Targets" /&gt;
</pre>
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Reload the project for the targets to take affect.</p>
          <p>
            In case you&rsquo;re wondering why the MSBuild instructions are so convoluted, this
            is done in order to make the SDK work well with continuous integration servers.
            See the <em>Continuous Integration</em> section for more information.</p>
          <p>
            <strong>Note:</strong> the above <code>.Targets</code> files do not reference every
            single assembly that is shipped with the SDK. References to some assemblies, such
            as DevExpress 8.0, are omitted. If you really need these references in your project,
            simply edit the project file and use the <code>ReSharperSdkBinaries</code> variable
            to reference the required assemblies. This variable is defined in the original SDK
            <code>.Target</code> files.</p>
          <p>
            <strong>Important note:</strong> it is highly recommended that you remove all existing
            project references to ReSharper before adding one of these targets file. Visual
            Studio is very sensitive to duplicated references and is likely to freeze if those
            occur.</p>
          <h3 id="DebuggingYourProject">
            Debugging Your Project</h3>
          <p>
            To debug your project, simply set Visual Studio (<code>devenv.exe</code>) as the
            debug target. In the parameter string, you will need to specify the key <code>/ReSharper.Plugin
              "full_path_to_your_plugin"</code>, providing the full path to the location of
            your plug-in (if you have several plug-ins, you can specify a folder here instead).</p>
          <h3 id="TestingYourProject">
            Testing Your Project</h3>
          <p>
            ReSharper contains project templates to create test projects. Test projects differ
            from plug-in projects in that they reference a different target file, which in turn
            references the assemblies related to ReSharper&rsquo;s test infrastructure.</p>
          <p>
            ReSharper&rsquo;s tests follow a &lsquo;convention over configuration&rsquo; approach.
            The following assumptions are made:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <p>
                Test data is kept in a folder relative to the folder where the compiled test assembly
                resides. This location can be specified individually in different fixtures, but
                the default assumption is that, if the solution files (i.e., the <code>.sln</code>
                file itself as well as the corresponding projects) are kept in an <code>\src</code>
                folder, then the test data files are kept in a nearby <code>\test</code> folder.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                Tests which require the &lsquo;before&rsquo; and &lsquo;after&rsquo; states are
                always named such that, if the initial state is named <code>SomeName.cs</code>,
                the final expected state is always named <code>SomeName.gold</code>.</p>
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Test files also support control identifiers. For example, to indicate the placement
            of the caret, one can use the <code>{caret}</code> indentifier right in the input/gold
            files.</p>
          <p>
            <strong>Important note:</strong> in order for tests to run, the version of the SDK
            must be <em>strictly less</em> than the version of ReSharper that you have installed.
            This is a technical limitation that will be overcome in future versions of the SDK.</p>

            Continuous Integration</h3>
          <p>
            Installation of the ReSharper SDK is not required in order to build a ReSharper
            plug-in. In fact, what you can do is simply keep the ReSharper SDK binaries and
            target files in the same folder (or nearby) folder as your plug-in in the source
            control system. Then, all you have to do at compilation time is set the <code>ReSharperSdkTargets</code>
            and <code>ReSharperSdk</code> properties to point to the location of the <code>.Targets</code>
            files.</p>
